# TCP-UDP-Server
This server application is designed solely for **receiving messages** from clients through both **TCP** and **UDP** protocols. Its primary function is to act as a simple communication endpoint, where clients can send data that the server will process. The server offers users the flexibility to select the protocol they want to work with, ensuring they can experiment with both **reliable, connection-oriented TCP** and **connectionless UDP** message transfers.

Upon running the application, the server will listen on a specified port for incoming connections. In the **TCP mode**, the server establishes a formal connection with clients, ensuring that every message sent is reliably delivered and acknowledged. This makes it useful for scenarios where message integrity is essential, such as real-time chat applications or file transfers.

In **UDP mode**, the server behaves differently due to the nature of the UDP protocol. Unlike TCP, there’s no handshake or connection setup, meaning that the server does not confirm the receipt of messages in the same way. However, the server is still designed to receive and process these messages without requiring a formal connection. This can be particularly useful in lightweight scenarios where speed and efficiency are prioritized over guaranteed message delivery, such as in gaming servers or real-time streaming.

While the application is intentionally kept simple for message reception, it serves as a practical tool for testing and understanding how server-client communication works across different protocols. This server could be expanded further by adding features such as logging, response handling, or even security measures like encryption for real-world use cases. However, in its current form, it’s an ideal base for anyone looking to learn or experiment with network communications, particularly focusing on receiving data over TCP and UDP.
