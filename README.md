# TCP-UDP-Server
This application is a foundational server-client communication tool, specifically built to handle TCP and UDP protocols. The server’s primary feature is the user’s ability to choose the communication protocol before starting a session. Once the program is initiated, it prompts the user to select whether they want to establish a TCP service or a UDP service, offering flexibility depending on the network requirements.

The TCP option ensures reliable data transmission, confirming every packet of data sent between the client and server. This makes it a great choice for more robust, connection-oriented communications where data integrity is essential. TCP also provides feedback about connection status, giving users confirmation that they have successfully connected to the server.

On the other hand, UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that there is no formal connection setup or confirmation when a client connects to the server. This can lead to confusion for users unfamiliar with the behaviour of UDP, as they may not see any acknowledgment when connecting to the server. To work around this, the application allows clients to send messages, which the server can process and respond to, offering the user a more concrete way of confirming that communication is taking place.

This tool is ideal for learning and experimentation in network environments, providing a hands-on approach to understanding server-client architecture and protocol differences. Users can set up a basic server on their local machine (or across a network) and connect to it from another system using tools like Netcat. For users running the server in a lab or testing environment, it is especially useful to observe and compare the differences between TCP and UDP communication methods.

Additionally, the application’s structure and functionality can be expanded further. Users can easily modify the code to include features like logging, data encryption, or firewall bypass testing, making it a flexible learning tool for network security and communication protocol behaviours.
