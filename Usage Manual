# How to use TCP/UDP server?

git clone https://github.com/Aaditya8888/TCP-UDP-Server.git

python3 tcp-udp server.py

Before running the code, you might need to install some libraries: 
pycryptodomex (for v3 and more), 
pycryptodome (for v2 and more)
clamd (scanning & analyzing files before downloading)

Select 1 or 2 for TCP or UDP to receive messages 

And as a sender we can use netcat.

nc IP Port (fot TCP)
nc -u IP Port (for UDP)
